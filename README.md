After pulling and npm installing, be sure to navigate to server/config and change the name of default-server.json to default.json and input your Atlas Collection connection string. 
Once that's finished, navigate to server and run npm run dev to start the server. There should be a message in the terminal that the server is now running. and what port it's running on (should be 5000).

Next, navigate to client and run 'npm run serve'. There should be a message in the terminal that it is up and running and which port it's running on (should be port 8000). Now you can make calls from the application to the database via the application.
